What a blast!

This trip report is long overdue, but I wanted to process some of my images to share with everyone before I posted.

It had been a couple of years since I had an opportunity to travel and meet with the [GIMP][] team again ([Leipzig][] was awesome) so I was really looking forward to this trip.  I missed the opportunity to head up to the great white North for last years meeting in Toronto.

## London Calling

I was going to the pre-LGM photowalk again this year so this time I decided to pack some bigger off-camera lighting modifiers for everyone to play with.  Here's a neat travelling photographer pro-tip: most airlines will let you carry on an umbrella as a "freebie" item.  They just don't specify that it _has_ to be an umbrella to keep the rain off you.  So I carried on my big Photek Softlighter II (luckily my light stands fit in my checked luggage).  Just be sure not to leave it behind somewhere - which I was paranoid about for most of my trip.  Luckily I was only changing planes in Atlanta.

A couple of (_bad_) movies and hours later I was in Heathrow.  I figured it wouldn't be much trouble getting through border control.  

I may have been a little optimistic about that.  

The __Border Force__ agent was quite nice and _super_ inquisitive.  So much so that I actually began to worry at some point (I think I must have spent almost 20 minutes talking to her) that she might not let me in!

She kept asking what I was coming to London for and I kept trying to explain to her what a "_Libre Graphics Meeting_" was.  This was almost a tragic comedy.  The idea of Free Software did not seem to compute to her and I was sorry I had even made the passing mention.  Her attention then turned to my umbrella and photography.  What was I there to photograph?  Who?  Why?  (Come to think of it, I should start asking myself those same questions more often...)

In the end I think she got bored with my answers and figured that I was far too awkward to be a threat to anything.



## Photowalk
We could not have asked for a better day of weather to conduct the photowalk!  The day was partly cloudy and just gorgeous (pretty much the complete _opposite_ to what I was expecting for London weather).

I want to thank [Ruth Catlow][] (http://ruthcatlow.net/) for allowing us to use the awesome space at [Furtherfield Commons][furtherfield] in Finsbury Park as a base for our photowalk!  They were amazingly accommodating and we had a wonderful time chatting in general about art and what they were up to at the gallery and space.

They have some really neat things going on at the gallery and space so be sure to check them out if you can!


### Going for a Walk with Friends
This is one of my favorite things about being able to attend LGM.  I get to take a stroll and talk about photography with friends that I only usually get to interact with through an IRC window. I also feel like I can finally contribute something back to these awesome people that provide software I use every day.

We meandered through the park and chatted a bit about various things.  Simon had brought along his external flash and wanted to play with off-camera lighting.  So we convinced Liam to stand in front of a tree for us and Simon ended up taking one of my favorite images from the entire trip.  This was Liam standing in front of the tree under the shade with me holding the flash slightly above him and to the camera right.

**[Photo of Liam by Simon!]**

We even managed to run into Barrie Minney while on our way back to the Commons building.  Aryeom and I started talking a little bit while walking when we crossed paths with some locals hanging out in the park.  One man in particular was quite outgoing and let Aryeom take his photo, leading to another fun image!

Upon returning to the Commons building we experimented with some of the pretty window light coming into the building along with some black panels and a model (Mairi).  This was quite fun as we were experimenting with various setups for the black panels and speedlights.  Everyone had a chance to try some shots out and to direct Mairi (who was _super_ patient and accommodating while we played).

I was having so much fun talking and trying things out with everyone that I didn't even take that many photos of my own!  This is one of my only images of Mairi inside the Commons.<br>

Towards the end of our day I decided to try getting my big Softlighter out and to try a few things in the lane outside the Commons building.  Luckily Michael Schumacher grabbed an image of us while we were testing some shots with Mairi outside.

I loved the lane receding in the background and thought it might make for some fun images of Mairi.  I had two YN-560 flashes in the Softlighter both firing around &frac34; power.  I had to balance the ambient sky with the softlighter so needed the extra power of a second flash (it also helps to keep the cycle times down).

The day was awesome and I really enjoyed being able to just hang out with everyone and take some neat photos.  The evening at the pub was pretty great also (I got to hang out with Barrie and his friend and have a couple of pints).



## LGM
It never fails to amaze me how every year the LGM organizers manage to put together such a great meeting for everyone.  The venue was great and the people were just fantastic at the University of Westminster.
