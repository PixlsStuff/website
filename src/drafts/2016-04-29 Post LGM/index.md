What a blast!

This trip report is long overdue, but I wanted to process some of my images to share with everyone before I posted.

It had been a couple of years since I had an opportunity to travel and meet with the GIMP team again (Leipzig was awesome) so I was really looking forward to this trip.  I missed the opportunity to head up to the great white North for last years meeting in Toronto.



## London Calling
I was going to be going to the photowalk before the meeting kicked off again this year and this time I decided to pack some bigger off-camera lighting modifiers for everyone to play with.  Here's a neat travelling photographer pro-tip: most airlines will let you carry on an umbrella as a "freebie" item.  They just don't specify that it _has_ to be an umbrella to keep the rain off you.  So I carried on my big Photek Softlighter II (luckily my light stands fit in my checked luggage).  Just be sure not to leave it behind somewhere - which I was paranoid about for most of my trip.  Luckily I was only changing planes in Atlanta.

A couple of (_bad_) movies and hours later I was in Heathrow.  I figured it wouldn't be much trouble getting through border control.  

I may have been a little optimistic about that.  

The __Border Force__ agent was quite nice and _super_ inquisitive.  So much so that I actually began to worry at some point (I think I must have spent almost 20 minutes talking to her) that she might not let me in!

She kept asking what I was coming to London for and I kept trying to explain to her what a "_Libre Graphics Meeting_" was.  This was almost a tragic comedy.  The idea of Free Software did not seem to compute to her and I was sorry I had even made the passing mention.  She also asked about my umbrella, which led to another series of questions that I'm sure didn't help my case (why are folks so suspicious of photographers in general?).



## Photowalk
We could not have asked for a better day of weather to conduct the photowalk!  The day was partly cloudy and just gorgeous (pretty much the complete _opposite_ to what I was expecting for London weather).

I want to thank [Ruth Catlow][] (http://ruthcatlow.net/) for allowing us to use the awesome space at [Furtherfield Commons][furtherfield] in Finsbury Park as a base for our photowalk!  They were amazingly accommodating and we had a wonderful time chatting in general about art and what they were up to at the gallery and space.

They have some really neat things going on at the gallery and space so be sure to check them out if you can!


### Going for a Walk with Friends
This is one of my favorite things about being able to attend LGM.  I get to take a stroll and talk about photography with friends that I only usually get to interact with through an IRC window.

* Pick some images of Mairi.
* Photo of Liam by Simon!
