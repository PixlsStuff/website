What a blast!

This trip report is long overdue, but I wanted to process some of my images to share with everyone before I posted.

It had been a couple of years since I had an opportunity to travel and meet with the GIMP team again (Leipzig was awesome) so I was really looking forward to this trip.  I missed the opportunity to head up to the great white North for last years meeting in Toronto.



## London Calling

I was going to be going to the photowalk before the meeting kicked off again this year and this time I decided to pack some bigger off-camera lighting modifiers for everyone to play with.  Here's a neat travelling photographer pro-tip: most airlines will let you carry on an umbrella as a "freebie" item.  They just don't specify that it _has_ to be an umbrella to keep the rain off you.  So I carried on my big Photek Softlighter II (luckily my light stands fit in my checked luggage).  Just be sure not to leave it behind somewhere - which I was paranoid about for most of my trip.  Luckily I was only changing planes in Atlanta.
