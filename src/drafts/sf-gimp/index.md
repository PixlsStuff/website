This is another test of the build system using browser-sync.

Testing again.

To whom it may concern:



We are fully aware that since the launch in 1999 Sourceforge has been providing a valuable service to the free software community and that this service today still is relevant to a lot of free and open source software projects. 

The GIMP project did benefit from this service: SourceForge was the place the download the Windows installer for GIMP for many years and we appreciate that this service was available as an important part of GIMP history.

When it comes to distributing GIMP our goal is to make it as easy as possible for users.
We do not want our users having to dodge any "offers" or to worry about possibly being laden with adware/malware in the process.

With our shared history it was painful to watch the invasion of the big green "Download" buttons appearing on your site.  Our decision to move the Windows installers away from SourceForge in 2013 was a direct result of how your service degraded in this respect.

The situation became worse when you started to ship your SourceForge downloader/installer around the project binaries.
To us this firmly places you among the dodgy crowd of download sites.
You are abusing the trust we've put into you in the past.

Unfortunately we don't believe that this is a fixable situation.
Even if you were promising to adhere to a set of guidelines outlined below these promises are likely to become worthless with any upcoming management change at SourceForge.

However, if your current management were willing to collaborate with us on these matters then we could at least have a solution for the time being.

An optimal solution would be to provide an option for any project to:

* Cease hosting at SF if desired, including the ability to:
  * completely remove the project and URL
  * remove any hosted files from the service
  * provide permanent HTTP redirects (301) to any other location as desired

These options are not unreasonable to expect from a service that purports to support the free-software community.
