First of all, glad to see you here!
Welcome aboard.

This article is an attmempt to help newcomers to [FOSS] (Free and Open Source Software) understand what options may be available to them and how they might relate to what they had previously been using.
The myriad of options and projects available can be a bit overwhelming. 


This article is not meant to be comprehensive but rather a general introduction to software used in more common workflows.


A common workflow that likely covers a large percentage of photographers would generally look something like this:

File Management &rarr; RAW processing &rarr; Pixel Editing

In commercial software terms, using Adobe as an example, these function may be handled by:


* It may seem daunting at first
 * many options
 * many projects
* The UNIX way
 * Do one thing well, chain commands together
* A short workflow example
 * Shooting RAW & processing options
 * Pixel editing with GIMP
 * Output (maybe exiftool?)
