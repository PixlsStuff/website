Community member and RawTherapee hacker Morgan Hardwood brings us a great tutorial + assets from one of his strolls near the [Söderåsen National Park][] (Sweden!).  After bugging [David Tschumperlé][] he managed to find a neat solution to generating a median (pixel) blend of a large number of images without making your computer throw itself out a window.  We finally relent and create a category on [discuss][] just for all those stinky [darktable][] users!  This website _finally_ has its source opened and [made available on Github][].

More detail on all of this (and more) in todays updates!
