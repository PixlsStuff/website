It was always my intention to make the entire PIXLS.US website available under a permissive license.  The content is all licensed [Creative Commons, By Attribution, Share-Alike][cc] here unless otherwise noted.  I just hadn't gotten around to actually posting the source for building the site.

Until now(ish).

Also, we finally have a category specifically for [darktable][] weenies on [discuss][]!

## Don't Laugh

I finally got around to pushing my code for this site up to [Github][] on April 27 (I'm basing this off git logs because my memory is likely suspect).  It took a while, but better late than never?  I think part of the delay was a bit of minor embarrassment on my part for being so sloppy with the site code.  In fact, I'm still embarrassed - so don't laugh at me too hard (and if you do, at least don't point while laughing too).

[Github]: https://github.com/pixlsus/

So really this post is just a reminder to anyone that was interested that this site is available on Github:  

https://github.com/pixlsus/.

In fact, we've got a couple of other repositories under the [Github Organization PIXLS.US](https://github.com/pixlsus) including this website, presentation assets, lighting diagram SVG's, and more. If you've got a Github account or wanted to join in with hacking at things, by all means send me a note and we'll get you added to the organization asap.

_Note_: you don't need to do anything special if you just want to grab the site code.  You can do this quickly and easily with:

`git clone https://github.com/pixlsus/website.git`

You actually don't even need a Github account to clone the repo, but you will need one if you want to fork it on Github itself, or to send pull-requests.

* darktable category on discuss.
* pixls website on github (+other repos)
