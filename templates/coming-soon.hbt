				<h2>So What&rsquo;s Coming?</h2>
				<p>I&rsquo;ve been writing about high-quality photography workflows on my <a href="http://blog.patdavid.net/p/getting-around-in-gimp.html">blog</a>.  However, I felt the community could use a good website dedicated to F/OSS photography that wasn&rsquo;t just about me. (Well, mostly).</p>

				<p>
					We have all of these amazing projects creating fantastic software, and we could use a place to help everyone realize their full potential (theirs and the software).

                    I am working hard to get various parts of the site up and running (as well as writing and editing new content).

                <h2><a href="/about">About Us</a></h2>
                <p>
                    I finally got an <a href="/about">About Page</a> setup to give you a little more information about the site and who&rsquo;s involved.
                </p>

                <h2><a href="/blog">The Blog</a></h2>
				<p>
				I just got the basic framework for the blog posts set up.
                You can follow along <a href="/blog/"><strong>the blog here</strong></a> to keep up with the site status.
				</p>
                <br/>
				<p>
				I&rsquo;ll be updating there as I build out more of the site.
				If you would like to contribute in any way, please feel free to reach out to me (I promise I don&rsquo;t bite).
